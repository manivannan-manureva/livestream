Step 1: Install Red5 app


copy the StreamRecorder application(Red5 - StreamRecorder -app\StreamRecorder) into the web-apps or dist/webapps folder on the red5 ( tested only with red5 v0.9 )

and DO NOT forget to set the file path settings on the 

WEB-INF/red5-web.properties file


On the Red5 Webapps directory there should be only the folder StreamRecorder

Upload the all files exluding the Flex Sources and Red5 app


chmod 0777 files directory

onfigure the values on the settings.php with the proper values

they are straight forward configuration..

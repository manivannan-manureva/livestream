Red5-Flex-Streamer
==================

This project which utilizes the Red5, Flex and PHP for Live Video Streaming and Recording has many features

1. Stream Live video to the viewers

2. Record the streams from your cam or other video input devices to the server

3. Preview the recorded streams and files and thumbnail the frame which you would like to display for the video.

4. Upload the videos from your computer and convert them to FLV which can be streamed using Red5 .

5. Choose from any resolutions

6. Can be plugged to any script

7. Each website user can have a separate Directory for storing their videos and thumbnails


Eeach user will have his own directory on the server.. We will delete all these files on the demo server once a day .

This project was meant to be a simple video tool which works on opensource technologies and allows the developers and webmasters to provide the Live Video streaming to the clients at low/no cost

What this project is about:

This video tool can be embedded to any website easily. You can either run a simple webcam streaming page which broadcast's your webcam on your website.

Or you could run a big video sharing website or a social network which allows the users to record their webcams and other devices to share with the other people

This video red5 recorder and streamer can help you .

This tool allows the user to pick his own thumbnail at any frame on the video .

What this project is not about:

A complete video solution.. which means there is no security features , user signup , authentication ,etc .. This tool is a starting point..

The project source is a great collection for those who build the functions like the thumbnail-er , Video capturing and the video streaming and Flex phpamf gateways and so on.

## Warning.

This is an old project of mine which was nearly dead on the Google code. I brought it to github just for historical purpose.

This might still work if you get your server working on Red 5 v0.8  or anything under 1.0 however you have to test it and Please give me a pull request if you have updated this .
